Background
-----------------------
	What is big data?
	How can we use it for our purposes?
	Why canâ€™t I just download it?
	

	Why are you still talking Tom? I want to get started!




Asking Questions
----------------

As we go through this lesson, you can ask questions in two ways:

1.  If you have a question for me, just raise your hand and ask.
2.  If you have a question that you think might be restricted to just you (like something on your computer isn't working), raise your hand an a volunteer 
will come over to help you individually.

What is R?
-----------

R is a versatile, open source programming language that was specifically designed for data analysis. As such R is extremely useful both for statistics and data science and was inspired by the programming language S.  Here are some fun facts to usher you into the R community.

* Open source software under GPL.
* Superior (if not just comparable) to commercial alternatives. R has over 5,000 user contributed packages at this time. It's widely used both in academia and industry.
* Available on all platforms.
* Not just for statistics, but also general purpose programming.
* Is (sort of) object oriented and functional.
* Large and growing community of peers.

Starting with RStudio
----------------------

To open RStudio, click on the RStudio icon in the Applications (if you are on a Mac) or in your Programs if you are on Windows.

There are four windows in RStudio that we will refer to throughout the workshop

1. *The R Script*: Typically the upper left hand corner of RSutdio.  This is where you write R code that you can save and reuse later.
2. *The R Console*: Typically in the lower left hand corner. This is where you execute R code.
3. *The R Environment*: Typically in the upper right hand corner. This is where you can see defined variables. 
4. *R "Information"*: Typically in the lower right hand corner. This is where you see plots, help and other R information.

For all the work in this workshop, we will be typing code in the R script and then executing it in the R console.  For simple commands (e.g. `2 + 2`) this may seem stupid, but writing in a script will help all of your work be reproducible! Think of the script as your lab notebook.
