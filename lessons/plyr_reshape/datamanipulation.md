Often times, data collection and data analysis are two completely separate processes. Manipulating data for various analyses and visualization can be facilitated by the package `reshape2`.

For our example, we will look at our dataset ____, which holds INFORMATION. 

    "23", "4", "34"
    "34", "4", "34"

we will use `read.csv` to load (into memory) the content of the CSV file. 

* reshape to vertical using melt, show how to do the opposite using dcast. 
* explain dplyr - split-apply-recombine .
* use dplyr to do summary based on one or many variables. 
* 
* graph using ggplot?
